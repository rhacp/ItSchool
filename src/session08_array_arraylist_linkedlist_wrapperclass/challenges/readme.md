Challenge 


1. Create a shopping list with Array and print the values
2. Create a wishlist for christmas with ArrayList and print the values
3. Create:
- 2 empty ArrayLists: studentList and graduateStudentList 
- populate studentList with 10 students
- copy values from studentList to graduateStudentList 
- iterate through graduateStudentList and print each graduated student
4. Given an array of 10 integers, count how many of them are even numbers and how many are odd. Print out both counts.
5. Create an ArrayList that stores city names. Add at least five city names initially. Then, prompt the user to add a city name. If the city name is already in the list, display a message saying it's a duplicate; otherwise, add it to the list.
6. Given a LinkedList storing student names, write a program that checks if a particular student name exists in the list. If it does, remove that name from the list.Challenge
7. Create an ArrayList containing names of fruits. Implement a custom sorting mechanism to arrange them in descending order based on their
   length. If two fruits have the same length, sort them in alphabetical order.
8. In an array of strings representing movie titles, implement a linear search method to find whether a given movie title exists. If it does, print
   out its position in the array.
9. Accept a string representation of a binary number, e.g., "1011". Convert this string into an Integer using the Integer wrapper class and the
   method that parses binary. Print out the decimal representation of this number.Challenge
10. Write a program that manages a personal diary using an ArrayList. Each entry in the diary is a string that contains a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" followed by a colon and the diary entry for that day. Your program should allow the user to: ● Add a new entry (but ensure there's no duplicate date). ● Edit an existing entry based on the date. ● Delete an entry by date. ● Display all entries in reverse chronological order (latest first).
    Ensure that all these operations are efficient, especially the addition of new entries, which should keep the list sorted without resorting it every time.
