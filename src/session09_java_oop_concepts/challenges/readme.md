Challenges:
1. College Management System - Design a system for a college to efficiently manage information about students, professors, and courses: <br /> <br />
   ● Store comprehensive profiles for every student, capturing their first name, last name, sex, age, date of birth, CNP, and address. <br />
   ● Similarly, maintain detailed profiles for every professor, including their first name, last name, sex, age, date of birth, CNP, and address. <br />
   ● The college offers eight distinct courses: Math, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, English, and History. For each course, track details like its schedule, duration, description, and the assigned professor. <br />
   ● Allow for the assignment of a professor to a specific course and ensure the ability to retrieve and view course details, including its assigned professor. <br />
   Note: Think about the needed classes, attributes and methods. We should master OOP principles and always find a way to transpose the objects from real life (or the business domain) to our application, with Java code. We should also know to explain the technical decisions we made. <br /> <br />
2. School Gradebook - Develop a gradebook system for a school where teachers can: <br /> <br />
   ● Add students to their classes.<br />
   ● Each student has a name and a unique student ID. <br />
   ● Assign grades for assignments or exams to each student. <br />
   ● Calculate the average grade for each student in their class. <br />
   ● View a list of all students and their respective average grades. <br /> <br />
3. Simple Banking Application - Construct a banking system that lets account holders: <br /> <br />
   ● Create an account with personal details and an initial deposit. <br />
   ● Deposit and withdraw money from their account. <br />
   ● Check their current balance. <br />
   ● View a summary of their recent transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance after each transaction. <br /> <br />
4. Fitness Tracking System - Design a system for individuals who want to track their fitness activities: <br /> <br />
   ● Users can log different types of workouts, such as running, weightlifting, or yoga. <br />
   ● Each workout type has specific attributes like duration, distance, or weight lifted. <br />
   ● Users can set weekly fitness goals, like running a certain number of kilometers or lifting a specific total weight. <br />
   ● Generate a summary at the end of the week, showing all logged workouts and indicating if the user met their goals. <br />
   ● Allow users to search and view their past workouts based on the type of activity or date. <br />
