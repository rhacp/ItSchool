# Vehicle

---

Create a superclass Vehicle and two subclasses Car and Truck. The superclass has a method fuelType returning "generic
fuel". Override this method in both subclasses: Car should return "petrol" and Truck should return "diesel". Now, create
objects of Car and Truck but reference them using Vehicle type and call the fuelType method.
